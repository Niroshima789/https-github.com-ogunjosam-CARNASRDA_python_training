# CARNASRDA_python_training

## INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON/QGIS PROGRAMMING FOR AIR POLLUTION DATA


Natural and anthropogenic activities drive dust movement around the world. An understanding of dust dynamics will help in mitigating the health implication.  The dearth of data on particulate matter in developing countries make it difficult to understand its behaviour and drivers.  Recently, CAR-NASRDA in partnership with ASEDA deployed low-cost Purple Sensors across West Africa. These sensors, for the first time, provide insight into the movement of dust across the region.   


This training will cover the Purple Air campaign globally, with Nigeria as a case study.  Participants will be trained on how to access, manipulate, and process Purple Air data using Python.  Topics to be covered include: Dust dynamics in Nigeria, introduction to Python environment, acquiring Purple air sensor data, data quality assessment, and analysis of data using Python.


The codes (Google Colab) used for this training can be accessed here.
